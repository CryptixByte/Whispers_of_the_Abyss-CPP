Currently under development [8/14/2024] :

This Will Currently House Information Surrounding The Development Of The Game Such As :
  - Various Mechanics & Features Being Worked On
  - What To Expect From Mechanics & Features In Development

##

Mechanics & Features In Development :
- [System] - [Progress]
- Skill Level System - The Level Tracking System Is Built, And I'm Currently Working On An Experience System 
- Character Level System - The Level Tracking System Is Built, But Same As Above I'm Currently Working On An Experience System

##What To Expect :
- [System] - [Expect]
- Skill Level System - My skill level system does take some insparation from Runescapes Skill leveling system, as I find it to be a system that allows someone to build their character how they want while offering a rewarding experience for leveling these skills up. However, I understand that Runescape's level system was designed with an element of a grind considering its an MMORPG, and because of this I'm planning on balancing the grind out as this game will just be a text RPG.
